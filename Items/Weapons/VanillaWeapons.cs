	// This file shows a very simple example of a GlobalItem class. GlobalItem hooks are called on all items in the game and are suitable for sweeping changes like 
	// adding additional data to all items in the game. Here we simply adjust the damage of the Copper Shortsword item, as it is simple to understand. 
	// See other GlobalItem classes in ExampleMod to see other ways that GlobalItem can be used.
