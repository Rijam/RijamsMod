Rijam's Mod for Terraria

Rijam's Mod is a bunch of random additions created by Rijam. This mod is mostly made as a learning experience, but feel free to check it out! Recipe Browser is highly recommended.

"Extemporaneous"

Includes:

3 Town NPCs
- Fisherman: sells bait, fish, fishing rods, and more. From my Fisherman NPC mod for 1.4
- - Arrives after the Angler has been rescued and there are 5 or more Town NPCs.
- Harpy: sells sky related items and a few extra things.
- - Find her in the sky.
- Interstellar Traveler: sells information items and weapons. Has a quest system.
- - Arrives if the player has an Odd Device in their inventory (Post-Evil Boss).

Many new items and weapons throughout the game's progression.
- 21 weapons: 3 Melee, 8 Ranged, 4 Magic, 6 Summoner.
- 16 accessories.
- 5 armor pieces.
- 8 vanity items + 3 dyes.

Some QoL changes
- Town NPCs sell more things.
- Fisherman NPC.
- Interstellar Traveler and Fisherman sell information items.

Some cross mod support:
- Support for Census - Town NPC Checklist.
- Harpy sells some items from other mods.
- Town NPC cross mod dialog.

Known Issues:
- In multiplayer, the Interstellar Traveler's quest system automatically completes the first quest. (It shouldn't be doing that)
- Summoner's Glove is a little buggy, details in its tooltip.
- Some items are unobtainable.

The code is open source if you extract the mod!
